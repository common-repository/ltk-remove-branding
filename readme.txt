== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want to remove WordPress branding? =

This plugin is not intended for webmasters, but for websites that will be used directly by customers who don't know or don't care about what WordPress is. For those people, there is some value in simplifying the interface and hiding some details. That is the main use case for the plugin.

= Does it modify anything in my website? =

No, it just hides some links, logos and notices that claim the website being WordPress. Visitors would not notice anything different at all, unless they check the HTML code, since generator meta tag is hidden.

= Does it hide or disable updates in any way? =

No, it just hides the flashy upgrade notices which show on top of the admin pages. Updates will show as usual in the updates page. Since most of the time updates are automatic (or performed by the webmaster, not the customer), we chose not to show those advices.
